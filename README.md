I'm currently building a composting toilet both to remedy the California drought, to satisfy my desire to be more sustainable, and to fix my somewhat disfunctional traditional toilet.

This includes a 3D Model of the Urine Adapater (which adapts a 5/8" OD vinyl tube to a water bottle) and a 3D Model for a urine diverter, which diverts the urine into a tube.

The reason I haven't had lots of GitHub commits lately is because I had been debating whether to put this on GitHub or not. It's here now though.

I'll write more explaining this entire thing in an assembly document.
